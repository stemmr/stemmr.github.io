# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hi, Arthur here. I am documenting my learnings in this blog in an effort to [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). I am a Software Engineer interested in a wide range of topics within ML and systems programming. Some things in particular I'd be happy to chat about include Rust, Efficient ML, Distributed Training, and Mechanistic Interpretability. Previously I have worked at AWS on cloud infrastructure where I was building the Amazon Bedrock model fine-tuning service as well as building out Elastic MapReduce on EKS before that.  

I hold an MS from Georgia Institute of Technology in Computer Science and a BS from Imperial College London in Electrical Engineering. During my studies I also did two internships, one at Athom in the Netherlands on home automation, and another at Parity Technologies in crypto.

While I am not hacking away in a Jupyter Notebook or waiting for Rust code to compile I enjoy long-distance running, cooking or reading/watching sci-fi (Dune has been my favorite most recently!)

Check out some my blog posts and tutorials bundled with this website.
