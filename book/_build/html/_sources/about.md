Hi, nice to meet you! I am a Software Engineer interested in a wide range of topics within ML and systems programming. Some things in particular I'd be happy to chat about include Rust, Efficient ML, Distributed Training, Mechanistic Interpretability. Previously I have worked at AWS on cloud infrastructure where I was building the Amazon Bedrock model fine-tuning service as well as building out Elastic MapReduce on EKS.  

I hold an MS from Georgia Institute of Technology in Computer Science and a BS from Imperial College London in Electrical Engineering. I also briefly did two internships, one at Athom BV in the Netherlands in home automation, and another at Parity Technologies.

While I am not hacking away in a Jupyter Notebook or waiting for Rust code to compile I enjoy long-distance running, cooking or reading/watching sci-fi (Dune has been my favorite!)
